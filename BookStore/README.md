### BookStore

This is a simple REST API which using MongoDB as database.

It includes this URLS:

+ /books -> GETMAPPING, POSTMAPPING

+ /books/authorName -> GETMAPPING(RequestParam authorName)

+ /books/{id} -> PUTMAPPING, DELETEMAPPING

I know that there are many deficient(exceptions, new controller methods etc.) at this API and i will work on them to fix.
